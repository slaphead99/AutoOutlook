<pre><code>
I want `deploy` only to be executed when on branch `master`.
I would write a PS script in `before_deploy` to test this.
But what kind of code would `before_deploy` have to execute to skip `deploy` without failing the build job?

How can I make the `artifacts` dependent on how the branch?
My goal is to set this up so that nothing apart from `master` can be deployed</code>
